        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Buddha (fl. circa 450 BCE) is the individual whose teachings form the basis
            of the Buddhist tradition. These
            teachings, preserved in texts known as the <b><i>Nikayas</i></b> or <b><i>Agamas</i></b>, concern the quest
            for liberation from
            suffering.
            While the ultimate aim of the Buddhas'teachings is thus to help individuals attain the good life, his
            analysis
            of the source of suffering centrally involves claims concerning the nature of persons, as well as how we
            acquire
            knowledge about the world and our place in it. These teachings formed the basis of a philosophical tradition
            that developed and defended a variety of sophisticated theories in metaphysics and epistemology.</p>

        <h2 id="A1">Buddha as Philosopher</h2>
        <p>This entry concerns the historical individual, traditionally called Gautama, who is identified by modern
            scholars
            as the founder of Buddhism. According to Buddhist teachings, there have been other Buddhas in the past, and
            there will be yet more in the future. The title <em>Buddha</em> , which literally means <em>awakened</em>,
            is
            conferred on an
            individual who discovers the path to nirvana, the cessation of suffering, and propagates that discovery so
            that
            others may also achieve nirvana. If the teaching that there have been other Buddhas is true, then Gautama is
            not
            the founder of Buddhism. This entry will follow modern scholarship in taking an agnostic stance on the
            question
            of whether there have been other Buddhas, and likewise for questions concerning the superhuman status and
            powers
            that some Buddhists attribute to Buddhas. The concern of this entry is just those aspects of the thought of
            the
            historical individual Gautama that bear on the development of the Buddhist philosophical tradition.</p>
        <p>The Buddha will here be treated as a philosopher. To so treat him is controversial, but before coming to why
            that
            should be so, let us first rehearse those basic aspects of the Buddha's life and teachings that are
            relatively
            non-controversial. Tradition has it that Gautama lived to age 80. Up until recently his dates were thought
            to be
            approximately 560-480 BCE, but many scholars now hold that he must have died around 405 BCE. He was born
            into a
            family of some wealth and power, members of the Śākya clan, in the area of the present border between India
            and
            Nepal. The story is that in early adulthood he abandoned his comfortable life as a householder (as well as
            his
            wife
            and young son) in order to seek a solution to the problem of existential suffering. He first took up with a
            number
            of different wandering ascetics (sramanas) who claimed to know the path to liberation from suffering.
            Finding
            their
            teachings unsatisfactory, he struck out on his own, and through a combination of insight and meditational
            practice
            attained the state of enlightenment (bodhi) which is said to represent the cessation of all further
            suffering.
            He
            then devoted the remaining 45 years of his life to teaching others the insights and techniques that had led
            him
            to
            this achievement. </p>

        <h2 id="A2">Core Teachings</h2>
        <ol>The Buddha's basic teachings are usually summarized using the device of the Four Noble Truths:
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <li>There is suffering.</li>
            <li>There is the origination of suffering.</li>
            <li>There is the cessation of suffering.</li>
            <li>There is a path to the cessation of suffering.</li>

        </ol>

        <p>The first of these claims might seem obvious, even when 'suffering' is understood to mean not mere pain but
            existential suffering, the sort of frustration, alienation and despair that arise out of our experience of
            transitoriness. But there are said to be different levels of appreciation of this truth, some quite subtle
            and
            difficult to attain; the highest of these is said to involve the realization that everything is of the
            nature of
            suffering. Perhaps it is sufficient for present purposes to point out that while this is not the implausible
            claim that all of life's states and events are necessarily experienced as unsatisfactory, still the
            realization
            that all (oneself included) is impermanent can undermine a precondition for real enjoyment of the events in
            a
            life: that such events are meaningful by virtue of their having a place in an open-ended narrative.</p>
        <p>It is with the development and elaboration of (2) that substantive philosophical controversy begins. (2) is
            the
            simple claim that there are causes and conditions for the arising of suffering. (3) then makes the obvious
            point
            that if the origination of suffering depends on causes, future suffering can be prevented by bringing about
            the
            cessation of those causes. (4) specifies a set of techniques that are said to be effective in such
            cessation.
            Much then hangs on the correct identification of the causes of suffering. The answer is traditionally
            spelled
            out in a list consisting of twelve links in a causal chain that begins with ignorance and ends with
            suffering
            (represented by the states of old age, disease and death). Modern scholarship has established that this list
            is
            a later compilation. For the texts that claim to convey the Buddha's own teachings give two slightly
            different
            formulations of this list, and shorter formulations containing only some of the twelve items are also found
            in
            the texts. But it seems safe to say that the Buddha taught an analysis of the origins of suffering roughly
            along
            the following lines: given the existence of a fully functioning assemblage of psychophysical elements (the
            parts
            that make up a sentient being), ignorance concerning the three characteristics of sentient
            existence—suffering,
            impermanence and non-self—will lead, in the course of normal interactions with the environment, to
            appropriation
            (the identification of certain elements as 'I' and 'mine'). This leads in turn to the formation of
            attachments,
            in the form of desire and aversion, and the strengthening of ignorance concerning the true nature of
            sentient
            existence. These ensure future rebirth, and thus future instances of old age, disease and death, in a
            potentially unending cycle.</p>
        <p>
            The key to escape from this cycle is said to lie in realization of the truth about sentient existence—that
            it is
            characterized by suffering, impermanence and non-self. But this realization is not easily achieved, since
            acts
            of appropriation have already made desire, aversion and ignorance deeply entrenched habits of mind. Thus the
            measures specified in (4) include various forms of training designed to replace such habits with others that
            are
            more conducive to seeing things as they are. Training in meditation is also prescribed, as a way of
            enhancing
            ones observational abilities, especially with respect to one's own psychological states. Insight is
            cultivated
            through the use of these newly developed observational powers, as informed by knowledge acquired through the
            exercise of philosophical rationality. There is a debate in the later tradition as to whether final release
            can
            be attained through theoretical insight alone, through meditation alone, or only by using both techniques.
            Ch'an, for instance, is based on the premise that enlightenment can be attained through meditation alone,
            whereas Theravāda advocates using both but also holds that analysis alone may be sufficient for some. (This
            disagreement begins with a dispute over how to interpret D I.77-84.) The third option seems the most
            plausible,
            but the first is certainly of some interest given its suggestion that one can attain the ideal state for
            humans
            just by doing philosophy.
        </p>

        <h2 id="A3">Non-Self</h2>
        <p>The Buddha's 'middle path' strategy can be seen as one of first arguing that there is nothing that the word
            'I'
            genuinely denotes, and then explaining that our erroneous sense of an 'I' stems from our employment of the
            useful fiction represented by the concept of the person. While the second part of this strategy only
            receives
            its full articulation in the later development of the theory of two truths, the first part can be found in
            the
            Buddha's own teachings, in the form of several philosophical arguments for non-self. </p>
        <ul>Best known among these is
            the argument from impermanence (S III.66-8), which has this basic structure:
            <li>If there were a self it would be permanent.</li>
            <li>None of the five kinds of psychophysical element is permanent.</li>
        </ul>



        <h2 id="A4">Karma and Rebirth</h2>
        <p>It is not just classical Indian self-theorists who have found this objection persuasive. Some Buddhists have
            as
            well. Among these Buddhists, however, this has led to the rejection not of non-self but of rebirth.
            (Historically this response was not unknown among East Asian Buddhists, and it is not rare among Western
            Buddhists today.) The evidence that the Buddha himself accepted rebirth and karma seems quite strong,
            however.
            The later tradition would distinguish between two types of discourse in the body of the Buddha's teachings:
            those intended for an audience of householders seeking instruction from a sage, and those intended for an
            audience of monastic renunciates already versed in his teachings. And it would be one thing if his use of
            the
            concepts of karma and rebirth were limited to the former. For then such appeals could be explained away as
            another instance of the Buddha's pedagogical skill (commonly referred to as upāya). The idea would be that
            householders who fail to comply with the most basic demands of morality are not likely (for reasons to be
            discussed shortly) to make significant progress toward the cessation of suffering, and the teaching of karma
            and
            rebirth, even if not strictly speaking true, does give those who accept it a (prudential) reason to be
            moral.
            But this sort of 'noble lie' justification for the Buddha teaching a doctrine he does not accept fails in
            the
            face of the evidence that he also taught it to quite advanced monastics (e.g., A III.33). And what he taught
            is
            not the version of karma popular in certain circles today, according to which, for instance, an act done out
            of
            hatred makes the agent somewhat more disposed to perform similar actions out of similar motives in the
            future,
            which in turn makes negative experiences more likely for the agent. What the Buddha teaches is instead the
            far
            stricter view that each action has its own specific consequence for the agent, the hedonic nature of which
            is
            determined in accordance with causal laws and in such a way as to require rebirth as long as action
            continues.
            So if there is a conflict between the doctrine of non-self and the teaching of karma and rebirth, it is not
            to
            be resolved by weakening the Buddha's commitment to the latter.</p>

        <h2 id="A5">Attitude toward Reason</h2>
        <p>There were some Buddhist philosophers who took 'neither the same nor different' in this way. These were the
            Personalists (Pudgalavādins), who were so called because they affirmed the ultimate existence of the person
            as
            something named and conceptualized in dependence on the psychophysical elements. They claimed that the
            person is
            neither identical with nor distinct from the psychophysical elements. They were prepared to accept, as a
            consequence, that nothing whatever can be said about the relation between person and elements. But their
            view
            was rejected by most Buddhist philosophers, in part on the grounds that it quickly leads to an ineffability
            paradox: one can say neither that the person's relation to the elements is inexpressible, nor that it is not
            inexpressible. The consensus view was instead that the fact that the person can be said to be neither
            identical
            with nor distinct from the elements is grounds for taking the person to be a mere conceptual fiction.
            Concerning
            the persons in the two lives, they understood the negations involved in 'neither the same nor different' to
            be
            of the commitmentless variety, i.e., to function like illocutionary negation. If we agree that the statement
            '7
            is green' is semantically ill-formed, on the grounds that abstract objects such as numbers do not have
            colors,
            then we might go on to say, 'Do not say that 7 is green, and do not say that it is not green either'. There
            is
            no contradiction here, since the illocutionary negation operator 'do not say' generates no commitment to an
            alternative characterization.</p> <br>
